# Sales-and-profitability-performance-dashboard-and-story
This project focus on turning raw sales data into practical insights that can drive smarter pricing, product focus and distribution decisions.
I analyzed a 4-year retail dataset (2014-2018), using SQL to clean geographic data and query profit trends. 
I identified a $20k loss in Tables and high-revenue/low-margin outliers.
The dashboard highlights sub-category performance, revealing both high peforming and loss making segments that requires strategic attention.
The state level map highlights regional performances differences, while the monthly trend shows how profits fluctuates over time.
I also examined the relationship between sales and profits margin gap to spot outliers.
